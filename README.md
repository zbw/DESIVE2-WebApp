# DESIVE²
The DESIVE² project investigates how health-related information, including misinformation, spreads across digital platforms. 
Through user participation, the project seeks to understand patterns in how people receive, share, and perceive health information, particularly when it may be inaccurate. 
DESIVE² emphasizes ethical data handling and privacy standards, conducting interviews and surveys via a secure app. 
Participants contribute valuable insights into the dynamics of digital health information dissemination.
